<h2>Editor.js</h2><p>Hey. Meet the new Editor. On this page you can see it in action ‚Äî try to edit this text.</p><h3>Key features</h3><ul><li>It is a block-styled editor</li><li>It returns clean data output in JSON</li><li>Designed to be extendable and pluggable with a simple API</li></ul><h3>What does it mean ¬´block-styled editor¬ª</h3><p>Workspace in classic editors is made of a single contenteditable element, used to create different HTML markups. Editor.js <mark class="cdx-marker">workspace consists of separate Blocks: paragraphs, headings, images, lists, quotes, etc</mark>. Each of them is an independent contenteditable element (or more complex structure) provided by Plugin and united by Editor's Core.</p><p>There are dozens of <a href="https://github.com/editor-js">ready-to-use Blocks</a> and the <a href="https://editorjs.io/creating-a-block-tool">simple API</a> for creation any Block you need. For example, you can implement Blocks for Tweets, Instagram posts, surveys and polls, CTA-buttons and even games.</p><code><pre>class ProfileSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user = UserSerlializer()

    class Meta:
        model = Profile
        fields = ['user', 'profile_type']

    def create(self, validated_data):
        user_data = validated_data.pop('user')
        profile = Profile.objects.create(**validated_data)
        user = User.objects.create(**user_data) # 1. creating user
        profile.user = user # 2. assigning user
        profile.save()  # 3. saving profile after adding user
        return profile # returning Profile instance.</pre></code><h3>What does it mean clean data output</h3><p>Classic WYSIWYG-editors produce raw HTML-markup with both content data and content appearance. On the contrary, Editor.js outputs JSON object with data of each Block. You can see an example below</p><p>Given data can be used as you want: render with HTML for <code class="inline-code">Web clients</code>, render natively for <code class="inline-code">mobile apps</code>, create markup for <code class="inline-code">Facebook Instant Articles</code> or <code class="inline-code">Google AMP</code>, generate an <code class="inline-code">audio version</code> and so on.</p><p>Clean data is useful to sanitize, validate and process on the backend.</p><hr/><p>We have been working on this project more than three years. Several large media projects help us to test and debug the Editor, to make it's core more stable. At the same time we significantly improved the API. Now, it can be used to create any plugin for any task. Hope you enjoy. üòè</p><figure><img src="https://capella.pics/6d8f1a84-9544-4afa-b806-5167d45baf7c.jpg" alt="Image-1" /><figcaption>Some caption.</figcaption></figure><p>Some Random text</p><figure><img src="/upload/temporary/o_de3075d9b4ba11862fab3ad24b4b5c3f.jpg" alt="Image-2" /><figcaption>Image with border and background color</figcaption></figure><p><b><mark class="cdx-marker">Ordered List</mark></b><br></p><ol><li>Number 1</li><li>Number 2</li></ol><figure><blockquote>Beautiful is better than ugly.Explicit is better than implicit.Simple is better than complex.Complex is better than complicated.Flat is better than nested.Sparse is better than dense.Readability counts.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.Although practicality beats purity.Errors should never pass silently.Unless explicitly silenced.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.Now is better than never.Although never is often better than *right* now.If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</blockquote><figcaption><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3">The Zen of Python</a></figcaption></figure><p><b>Some Bold Text.</b><br></p>
